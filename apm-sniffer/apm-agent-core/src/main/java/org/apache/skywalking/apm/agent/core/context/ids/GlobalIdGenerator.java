     * The second one represents thread id. (most likely just an integer value, would be helpful in protobuf)

     * The third one also has two parts,
     * 1) a timestamp, measured in milliseconds
     * 2) a seq, in current thread, between 0(included) and 9999(included)
     *
     * Notice, a long costs 8 bytes, three longs cost 24 bytes. And at the same time, a char costs 2 bytes. So
     * sky-walking's old global and segment id like this: "S.1490097253214.-866187727.57515.1.1" which costs at least 72
