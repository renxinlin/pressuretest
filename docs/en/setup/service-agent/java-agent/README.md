# Setup java agent
1. Agent is available for JDK 1.6 - 12.
1. Find `agent` folder in SkyWalking release package
1. Set `agent.service_name` in `config/agent.config`. Could be any String in English.
1. Set `collector.backend_service` in `config/agent.config`. Default point to `127.0.0.1:11800`, only works for local backend.
1. Add `-javaagent:/path/to/skywalking-package/agent/skywalking-agent.jar` to JVM argument. And make sure to add it before the `-jar` argument.

The agent release dist is included in Apache [official release](http://skywalking.apache.org/downloads/). New agent package looks like this.
```
+-- agent
    +-- activations
         apm-toolkit-log4j-1.x-activation.jar
         apm-toolkit-log4j-2.x-activation.jar
         apm-toolkit-logback-1.x-activation.jar
         ...
    +-- config
         agent.config  
    +-- plugins
         apm-dubbo-plugin.jar
         apm-feign-default-http-9.x.jar
         apm-httpClient-4.x-plugin.jar
         .....
    +-- optional-plugins
         apm-gson-2.x-plugin.jar
         .....
    +-- bootstrap-plugins
         jdk-http-plugin.jar
         .....
    +-- logs
    skywalking-agent.jar
```

- Start your application.

## Supported middleware, framework and library
SkyWalking agent has supported various middlewares, frameworks and libraries.
Read [supported list](Supported-list.md) to get them and supported version.
If the plugin is in **OptionalÂ²** catalog, go to [optional plugins](#optional-plugins) section to learn how to active it.

## Advanced features
- All plugins are in `/plugins` folder. The plugin jar is active when it is in there. Remove the plugin jar, it disabled.
- The default logging output folder is `/logs`.

## Install javaagent FAQs
- Linux Tomcat 7, Tomcat 8  
Change the first line of `tomcat/bin/catalina.sh`.
```shell
CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/path/to/skywalking-agent/skywalking-agent.jar"; export CATALINA_OPTS
```

- JAR file  
Add `-javaagent` argument to command line in which you start your app. eg:
 ```shell
 java -javaagent:/path/to/skywalking-agent/skywalking-agent.jar -jar yourApp.jar
 ```

- Jetty  
Modify `jetty.sh`, add `-javaagent` argument to command line in which you start your app. eg:
```shell

## Optional Plugins
Java agent plugins are all pluggable. Optional plugins could be provided in `optional-plugins` folder under agent or 3rd party repositories.
For using these plugins, you need to put the target plugin jar file into `/plugins`.

Now, we have the following known optional plugins.
* [Plugin of tracing Spring annotation beans](agent-optional-plugins/Spring-annotation-plugin.md)
* [Plugin of tracing Oracle and Resin](agent-optional-plugins/Oracle-Resin-plugins.md)
* [Filter traces through specified endpoint name patterns](agent-optional-plugins/trace-ignore-plugin.md)
* Plugin of Gson serialization lib in optional plugin folder.
* Plugin of Lettuce 5.x(JRE 8+) in optional plugin folder. Agent is compatible in JDK 1.6+, this plugin could be used in JRE 8+, by matching the lib requirement.
* Plugin of Zookeeper 3.4.x in optional plugin folder. The reason of being optional plugin is, many business irrelevant traces are generated, which cause extra payload to agents and backends. At the same time, those traces may be just heartbeat(s).
* [Customize enhance](Customize-enhance-trace.md) Trace methods based on description files, rather than write plugin or change source codes.
* Plugin of Spring Cloud Gateway 2.1.x in optional plugin folder. Please only active this plugin when you install agent in Spring Gateway. spring-cloud-gateway-2.x-plugin and spring-webflux-5.x-plugin are both required.
* Plugin of [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) 2.6+ (JDK 1.8 required & Scala 2.12/2.13) in optional plugin folder. Please only active this plugin when you install agent in [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/). 
* Plugin of Spring Transaction in optional plugin folder. The reason of being optional plugin is, many local span are generated, which also spend more CPU, memory and network.
* Plugin of Spring Webflux 5.x in the optional plugin folder. Because the plugin requires JDK 1.8+.

## Bootstrap class plugins
All bootstrap plugins are optional, due to unexpected risk. Bootstrap plugins are provided in `bootstrap-plugins` folder.
For using these plugins, you need to put the target plugin jar file into `/plugins`.

Now, we have the following known bootstrap plugins.
* Plugin of JDK HttpURLConnection. Agent is compatible with JDK 1.6+
* Plugin of JDK Callable and Runnable. Agent is compatible with JDK 1.6+

## Advanced Features
* Set the settings through system properties for config file override. Read [setting override](Setting-override.md).
* Use gRPC TLS to link backend. See [open TLS](TLS.md)
* Monitor a big cluster by different SkyWalking services. Use [Namespace](Namespace.md) to isolate the context propagation. 
* Set client [token](Token-auth.md) if backend open [token authentication](../../backend/backend-token-auth.md).
* Application Toolkit, are a collection of libraries, provided by SkyWalking APM. Using them, you have a bridge between your application and SkyWalking APM agent. 
    * If you want to use OpenTracing Java APIs, try [SkyWalking OpenTracing compatible tracer](Opentracing.md). More details you could find at http://opentracing.io
    * If you want to print trace context(e.g. traceId) in your logs, choose the log frameworks, [log4j](Application-toolkit-log4j-1.x.md), 
[log4j2](Application-toolkit-log4j-2.x.md), [logback](Application-toolkit-logback-1.x.md)
    * If you want to use annotations or SkyWalking native APIs to read context, try [SkyWalking manual APIs](Application-toolkit-trace.md)
    * If you want to continue traces across thread manually, use [across thread solution APIs](Application-toolkit-trace-cross-thread.md).
* If you want to specify the path of your agent.config file. Read [set config file through system properties](Specified-agent-config.md)

## Plugin Development Guide
SkyWalking java agent supports plugin to extend [the supported list](Supported-list.md). Please follow 
our [Plugin Development Guide](../../../guides/Java-Plugin-Development-Guide.md).

If some RPC framework endpoints(server side) could include parameter, please read [Operation Name Group Rule](op_name_group_rule.md),
and consider to add this feature.

# Test
If you are interested in plugin compatible tests or agent performance, see the following reports.
